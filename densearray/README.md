# densearray

This is the densearray project.
Something like this was in Google Code Review.

Features:
- Checks DenseArray holes for O(1);
- Inserts for O(log N);
- Checks for O(log N);

This is not a template implementation, but could be easily transform (and with concepts).

# Building and installing
