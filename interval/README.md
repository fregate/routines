# interval

This is the interval map project.

Used in tech interview for think-cell.

It cannot pass second check about 'map have to regular' or somethink like that. This error like underlying map has to contain only one key for whole interval, like {'B', 10}, {'A', 20} not {'B', 10}, {'B',12}, {'A', 20}
I can't provide test where current implementation produce this bug.
